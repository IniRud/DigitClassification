### Introduction

This project demonstrates the use of machine learning to recognize handwritten digits. It utilizes the `Optical Recognition of Handwritten Digits` dataset from scikit-learn, which contains 8x8 pixel grayscale images of digits. The model is trained to classify each image into one of 10 classes, representing digits from 0 to 9.

### Dataset

- **Source**: [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Optical+Recognition+of+Handwritten+Digits)
- **Description**: The dataset contains 1,797 8x8 grayscale images, each representing a handwritten digit. Each image has 64 features, corresponding to pixel intensity values, with labels for each digit (0–9).
- **Preprocessing**: Images are normalized to ensure consistent pixel values.

### Project Structure

- `digit_classification.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook file containing the code and analysis.
- `images/`: Directory containing example images from the dataset (if applicable).
- `results/`: Directory for storing model outputs, accuracy metrics, or visualizations (if applicable).

### Installation

To set up the project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DigitClassification.git
   cd DigitClassification
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   - It’s recommended to use a virtual environment.
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   - Alternatively, you can use `pip install numpy matplotlib scikit-learn` if there is no `requirements.txt` file.

### Usage

1. **Run the Jupyter Notebook**:
   - Open `digit_classification.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
   - Follow the cells in sequence to load the data, preprocess it, train the model, and visualize the results.

2. **Training and Testing**:
   - The notebook includes code for training a machine learning model to classify digits. It uses a train-test split to evaluate model accuracy.

3. **Example Prediction**:
   - After training, you can test the model on sample images to see how well it classifies the handwritten digits.

### Results

- Include a brief description of your model’s performance.
- For example, you could list metrics like **accuracy** or **confusion matrix** results.
- (Optional) Visualizations of sample predictions, highlighting both correct and incorrect classifications.

### Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you’d like to improve the model or add new features, feel free to fork the repository and submit a pull request.
